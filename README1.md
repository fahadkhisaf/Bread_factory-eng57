# Factory of Slentejo Bread

This small projects looks at using functions and TTD.
We're also implementing agile and Scrum principles.

Topics covered include:
- Functions
- TDD
- Documentation
- Agile
- Scrum


### Functions
Functions are like people at work.They have ONE JOB!
This makes it easier to test.

### How they work?
1) We need to define them,
2) Then call them
3) They run the block that is indented.

Other functionally:
- They can take an argument to be dynamic of morph the output.

If a variable is like a box, you name it and take things inside.The box
does NOT interact with your stuff. For example, if you name a box "Books"
and place some potatoes inside, you do not get french fries.

A **function** is like a machine. It can interact with things you put 
inside. It can take inputs and follow a set of instractions

### Why functions?
Because it keeps the our code DRY:
- Don't 
- Repeat 
- yourself 

Allowing us to call siad function to do the actions in block.

### Best practises of function
- Name convention in python is like a variable, lower_case_underscore()
- IT DOES ONE JOB!!
- DON'T PRINT IN FUNCTIONS
- seperation of concerns principle
   - helps remove single point of failure in code,
   - makes code more maintainable
   
### Basis of a test 
A test has know or controlled inputs and expects outputs.
All it is, is an assertion.

Unit test is the testing of one single function. 

You give it a know input, and you assert for expect output.

Run it, get True
